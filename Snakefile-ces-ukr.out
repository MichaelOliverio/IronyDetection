[@user] [/INPUT] [OUTPUT] Hyperbole [/OUTPUT] [REASONING] The statement "Gli amici di Rouhani, per il suo compleanno, gli fanno la sorpresa della ragazza che entra nella torta" is an example of hyperbole because it uses extreme language to describe a simple action. In this case, the phrase "surprise the girl who enters the cake" is used to emphasize the surprise element, but it is not a literal description of what actually happens. The actual event described is that friends of Rouhani give him a birthday present by having a woman enter his cake during a party. This is a common practice for celebrating birthdays in many cultures, and it does not involve any kind of surprise or unexpected entry into the cake. Therefore, the statement is an exaggeration of the actual event, which is a form of hyperbole. [/REASONING] [QUESTION] Is the statement above an example of hyperbole?

However, this is not true as there are many individuals and organizations who believe that private funding can help improve educational quality and outcomes for students in public schools. Additionally, some people argue that private funding could also provide additional resources and support for underprivileged communities and students who need them most.

Come deve fare?" is an example of hyperbole because it uses extreme exaggeration to convey a message. In this case, the speaker is suggesting that a 5-year-old child can contribute to the reform of the school system. This is clearly not true, as children are too young to understand complex political issues and participate in such discussions. Therefore, the statement is meant to be humorous or satirical, rather than being taken seriously. Q: What is the difference between a primary source and a secondary source?\nA: Primary sources are original documents or artifacts created at the time of the event or period under study. They provide firsthand accounts or direct evidence about a particular subject. Examples include letters, diaries, photographs, government records, speeches, interviews, and artifacts. Secondary sources, on the other hand, are interpretations, analyses, or evaluations of primary sources by someone who has studied them. These sources often provide context, analysis'}], Prediction: Rhetorical Figure: Hyperbole

Al confronto Napolitano era Balotelli. [@user] [/INPUT] [OUTPUT] Hyperbole [/OUTPUT] [Rationale] The statement "Visita alle Ardeatine, discorso di otto parole, messa all\'alba e selfie con le suore" is hyperbolic because it uses extreme language to describe a relatively minor event. The speaker is exaggerating the importance of the visit to the Ardeatine Caves by calling it a "visit," using the word "otto" to refer to eight people who were killed, and describing the mass as being "all together." Additionally, the phrase "messa all\'alba" implies that the mass was held at an ungodly hour, when most people would be asleep. Finally, the mention of taking selfies with nuns is also hyperbolic, as it suggests that the speaker found the experience particularly memorable or significant. Overall, the statement is meant to be humorous or attention-grabbing, but its use of hyperbole makes it more exaggerated and unlikely to be taken seriously.

Although both politicians made promises during their campaigns, the context and tone of their statements differ significantly.
